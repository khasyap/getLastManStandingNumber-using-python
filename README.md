# Get Last Man Standing Number Using Python

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project implements an efficient algorithm to find the **last man standing number** — a variation of the Josephus problem — using Python. Given a list of numbers or positions, the script determines which number remains last after repeatedly eliminating every nth element.

This is a classic combinatorial problem often used to demonstrate recursion, iterative reduction techniques, and optimized solutions.

## 🚀 Features
- 📌 Finds the last remaining number based on elimination rules
- 🔁 Supports iterative and recursive methods
- 🧪 Easy to test with custom inputs
- 🐍 Built with Python for simplicity and readability

## 🧾 Problem Description
In a group of people/items numbered from 1 to N, every k-th item is removed in each round until only one remains. The goal is to determine the position (number) of the last remaining item.

This problem is commonly known as a variation of the Josephus Problem and has applications in algorithm design and game theory.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
